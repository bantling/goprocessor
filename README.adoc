A microprocessor
----------------

A microprocessor that is intended only for a virtual environment.

. 4 Register Sets containing:
.. General Purpose Register R (64-bit signed/unsigned)
.. Pointer Register PTR (32-bit unsigned)
.. Offset Register OFS (16-bit unsigned)
.. Index Register IX (16-bit unsigned)
.. Index Step Register IS (16-bit signed)
. 4 Counter Register CTR (32-bit unsigned)
. 4 Counter Step Registers CS (16-bit signed)
. 4 Timer Registers TMR (32-bit unsigned)
.. Max 32-bit unsigned value is 4,294,967,295
.. Millisecond precision, so max value = 4,294,967.295 seconds = 71,582.788 minutes = 1193.05 hours = 49.71 days
. 4 Timer Pointer Registers TPTR (32-bit)
. 1 Program Counter PC (32-bit)
. 1 Code Pointer CP (32-bit)
. 1 Stack Base Register SB (32-bit, lowest address)
. 1 Stack Limit Register SL (32-bit, highest address)
. 1 Stack Pointer Register SP (32-bit, current address)
. 1 Status Register ST (16-bit)
.. CP is base address of a program
.. The PTR, TPTR, PC, SB, SL, and SP registers are all relative to CP
.. All branches and jumps are relative to CP except JMPA/JSRA, to allow for a kernel jump table
.. Programs are relocatable
. 1 Interrupt Disable bit in memory location 0
. ST layout
.. CVZNAAAJ WWRROODD
.. Carry, oVerflow, Zero, Negative, Address mode, Jump mode
.. Write register set, Read register set, Operand mode, Decimal mode
.. Address Mode (assume PTR = 100, OFS = 25, IX = 400, address 100 has 32 bit pointer to address 200)
... 000 = PTR: PTR = 100
... 001 = (PTR): PTR + OFS = 100 + 25 = 125
... 010 = [PTR]: PTR + IX = 100 + 400 = 500
... 011 = ([PTR]): PTR + IX + OFS = 100 + 400 + 25 = 525
... 100 = *PTR: *PTR = 200
... 101 = (*PTR): *PTR + OFS = 200 + 25 = 225
... 110 = [*PTR]: *PTR + IX = 200 + 400 = 600
... 111 = ([*PTR]): *PTR + IX + OFS = 200 + 400 + 25 = 625
... The * address modes always read a 32 bit pointer, they don't depend on the jump mode
.. Jump size is short (J = 0: branch 8 bits, jump 16 bits) or long (J = 1: branch 16 bits, jump 32 bits)
.. Branches and jumps are signed, except for JMPA and JSRA which are unsigned absolute addresses
.. Write/Read register set = Register set(s) to use for an instruction
.. Computation instructions work on selected Write/Read general registers, referred to as W and R
.. Operand size
... 00 = 8 bits
... 01 = 16 bits
... 10 = 32 bits
... 11 = 64 bits
.. Decimal Mode (Fixed and Floating Point are 16 bits for Operand Size 00)
... 00 = Integer
... 01 = Fractional
... 10 = Fixed Point
... 11 = Floating Point
.. In Floating Point Mode:
... Carry = NaN
... Zero = Divide By Zero
. Integer math
.. Carry Flag = 1 is carry for ADC, borrow for SBC, modulo for DIV, no meaning for MUL
.. Each of the relevant CVZN flags are modified on each instruction
.. EG, if only the CV flags are relevant to an instruction, then only those two are modified
. Fractional math
.. 
. Fixed point math
.. When operand size is 8 or 16 bits, use 16 bits, 32 bits = 32 bits, 64 bits = 64 bits
.. Scaling factor and min/max range limited to decimal values
... 16 bits: scaling factor = 10^-2, range = +/-99.99
... 32 bits: scaling factor = 10^-4, range = +/-99,999.9999
... 64 bits: scaling factor = 10^-8, range = +/-99,999,999,999.99999999
.. Existing ADC, DIV, MUL, SBC, CMP become fixed point instructions
... VZN flags have same meaning as integer instructions
... Carry Flag = 1 has no meaning in ADC, SBC, and MUL, indicates modulo for DIV
. Floating point instructions
.. When operand size is 8 or 16 bits, use Half Precision, 32 bits = Single Precision, 64 bits = Double Precision
.. Existing ADC, DIV, MUL, SBC, CMP become FP instructions
... Carry Flag = 1 has no meaning in ADC, SBC, and MUL, indicates modulo for DIV
.. Unary
... FS2F - signed integer to floating point: W(int -> float) 
... FF2S - floating point to signed integer: W(float -> int)
... FU2F - unsigned integer to floating point: W(uint -> float)
... FF2U - floating point to unsigned integer: W(float -> uint)
... FABS - absolute value: W = ABS(W)
... FCEL = ceiling: W = CEIL(W)
... FFLR = floor: W = FLOOR(W)
.. Binary
... FPOW - power: W = W ^ R
... FCOS - cosine: W = COS(R)
... FSIN - sine: W = SIN(R)
... FTAN - tangent: W = TAN(R)
... FACS - arc cosine: W = ACOS(R)
... FASN - arc sine: W = ASIN(R)
... FATN - arc tangent: W = ATAN(R)
... FLOG - logarithm base 10: W = LOG10(R)
... FNLG - natural logarithm: W = LOGe(R)
... FSQR - square root: W = SQRT(R)
